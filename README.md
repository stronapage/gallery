# Github Pages Gallery
Host your photo/video gallery in Github pages easily using Thumbsup & Github Actions for free.

### Why this project?
This project contains starter code for anyone who wants to deploy his/her photo/video galery on Github Pages,
**Zero Coding Needed**. Since Github pages is a free hosting service offered by Github to host static pages, it
offers a decent bandwidth. So it is a great choice for photographers to showcase their works. Github Actions is a CI & CD
platform that offers unlimited builds for open source projects. Combining the power of GitHub pages with Github Actions is
a zero dollar solution to get your gallery online.

## Limitations
* Github Pages [terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/):
> If your bandwidth usage significantly exceeds the average bandwidth usage (as determined solely by GitHub) of other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to immediately disable your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

* File size limit (100 MB) & Repo size limit (75 GB) & Upload limit(25MB): Github limits the maximum usable filesize as 100MB for all files. This is enough for most users. It also imposes a repo size limit of 75GB. If you add a file to a repository via a browser, the file can be no larger than 25 MB. Visit https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/ for more info.


## Tools Used
* [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) For continuous deployment.
* [Thumbsup](https://thumbsup.github.io/) for gallery static page generation.

### History
